This repository was created to demonstrate Cindy's candidacy for the credit risk analyst and fraud risk analyst positions at Rapid Finance. 

This project was completed on PostgreSQL and is a visual data analysis of fraudulent transactions. The charts used in this analysis were created using hvPlot. Data used in this project are not real transactions and was created purely for academic purposes.
